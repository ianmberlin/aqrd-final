This ZIP file contains the U.S. Census Bureau's data base providing 
historical statistics on State Tax Collections.  

It spans state government fiscal years between 1951 and 2017 (plus limited data 
for even years between 1942 and 1950 and National totals going back to 1902) 
and covers the finance topics of state tax collections.

The U.S. Census Bureau sponsors and conducts this census of state 
governments as authorized by Title 13, United States Code, Section 161 and 182.

The Census Bureau implemented significant changes to its classification system
for statistics on state government finances effective with FY 2005 data. Some 
of these changes will be obvious (e.g., new variables, no more data for existing
ones, large increases due to expanded coverage of variable). Others, however, 
will not be as apparent.

====================	
UNIVERSE DESCRIPTION	
====================
	
The data cover the 50 state governments only. No local government data are 
included and should not be interpreted as state-area data (state government 
plus local government tax collections combined.)

The state government tax data presented by the U.S. Census Bureau may differ 
from data published by state governments because the Census Bureau may be 
using a different definition of which organizations are covered under the 
term, “state government”.

For the purpose of State Government Tax Collections statistics, the term 
“state government” refers not only to the executive, legislative, and judicial 
branches of a given state, but it also includes agencies, institutions, 
commissions, and public authorities that operate separately or somewhat 
autonomously from the central state government but where the state government 
maintains administrative or fiscal control over their activities as defined 
by the Census Bureau.

For further information on the definition and organization of governments, 
see Chapter 1 of the Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual 
and the 2007 Census of Governments.	

 
==========================	
SUBJECT MATTER DESCRIPTION	
==========================	
	
This data base contains statistics on up to 25 State Tax items. 

These tax data are in thousands of dollars.

Statistics on the State Government Tax Collections Survey include 
measurement of tax by category: Property Tax, Sales and Gross Receipts 
Taxes, License Taxes, Income Taxes, and Other Taxes. Each tax category 
is broken down into sub-categories (e.g., motor fuel sales, alcoholic 
beverage sales, motor vehicle licenses, alcoholic beverage licenses, 
and so on). There are currently 25 different tax codes that state tax 
revenue may fall into.	

The tax statistics are in terms of current dollar amounts as originally 
reported. They have not been adjusted for price and wage changes occurring 
through the years.

The statistics reflect state government fiscal years that end on June 30, 
except for four states with other ending dates: 

Alabama and Michigan (September 30), New York (March 31), and Texas (August 31).
